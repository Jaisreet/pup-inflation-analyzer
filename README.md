GitHub Page: Pup Inflation Analyzer: Analyzing @dog_rates Tweets

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the "Pup Inflation Analyzer: Analyzing @dog_rates Tweets" GitHub repository. This project aims to investigate grade inflation on the popular @dog_rates Twitter account, which rates the cuteness of users' dog pictures. We will analyze the provided dataset of tweets, perform data processing and visualization tasks, and calculate a best-fit line to understand trends and potential inflation in the ratings.

**Instructions:**
To access and run the analysis notebook, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/jaisreet/pup-inflation-analyzer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory: Move into the project directory using the command:
```
cd pup-inflation-analyzer
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: Launch the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command in the project directory:
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open a browser window with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

4. Access the analysis notebook: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, click on the "pup-inflation-analyzer.ipynb" notebook to open and run it.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook: The notebook contains step-by-step instructions to perform the analysis. Execute each cell to load the data, process it, visualize the results, and calculate the best-fit line using linear regression.

6. View the results: The notebook will generate scatter plots, provide information about the dataset, display the slope and intercept of the best-fit line, and produce a scatter plot with the fitted line. The results will be shown within the notebook.

**Additional Information:**
- The notebook utilizes pandas, matplotlib, and scipy libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and linear regression.
- Ensure that the "dog_rates_tweets.csv" file is present in the same directory as the notebook.
- Make sure to save and run the notebook completely to view the results accurately.
